        <h3> The Set-up </h3>
        <p>
          In order to see Anthony Gregorc's <a href = "http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">mind styles</a> in action, I've assembled an Actor's Theater cast of Dr. Seuss characters to illustrate the four modes of thinking. Consider The Lorax in Abstract Sequential role, the lonely expert. Each of these modalities are ways that these characters approaches the world.  It's almost like studying for the Analytic Section at a GRE <a href = "http://www.wsj.com/articles/kaplan-to-buy-software-development-school-dev-bootcamp-1403660869">Kaplan</a> test prep course. Each of the abstract and concrete columns cross the sequential and random columns. The exercise explores what happens when things go right and when things go wrong. All the characters are about to enter the weekly "go around the table" meeting.
        </p>
          <ul>
              <li>
              Enter Cindy Loo Who our Concrete Sequential thinker. Cindy is a newcomer who is always on time. She comes with a clipboard with all the names of her team members. She taps her pen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enter the Lorax our Abstract Sequential thinker. The Lorax, is an expert who works best by himself. He comes from the abstract world of science working to solve the world's problems one by one. He folds his hands and sighs.
          </li>
          <li>
              Enter Thing #1 and Thing #2. The Concrete Random thinkers are discussing a topic with gusto. They each grab chairs and simultaneously offer one to the other. They get it sorted, take a seat and pause for a breath.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter Max the Manager.  Ever the Abstract Random thinker, he's happy to see everyone gathered in one place for the weekly check-in. It means so much to him.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3> The Four Thinking Styles in Harmony </h3>
          <p>In real life, a person may fall into one dominant thinking style while inhabiting one of the other three from time to time. And another person may provide a reciprocal relationship to our thinking style. Sometimes, that reciprocal relationship is harmonious: when one person is a talker the other person is a listener. Let's explore a meeting scenario where all thinking styles are working together.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Max says: I'm glad to see everyone. It means so much to me. I thought we'd share how we are feeling about all our projects this week. It's been busy so I haven't been able to check in with you all personally. Cindy would like to tell us all how you are doing? (Abstratct Randoms like to talk about feelings.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Cindy says: Oh, I'm glad to go first. I've made a map of where I think we are in the six phases of software development. I'm working on user cases this week so that I can make some progress on contacting people next week. I'd like to hear some direction from The Lorax about usability expectations.(Concrete Sequentials like to go in order.)
        </li>
        <li>
          The Lorax sighs and begins: I'd like to say a few things about what I've been contemplating this week. This project fits well with my vision of using the Radio Tower Pattern to build a messenger bus in Erlang. We'll also need the fifth normal form to locate records that have been falling through the cracks. I'll need some time to come up with a strategy that we can use in the lab.
        <li>
        Thing One says:  Well, Thing Two and I were just having an exchange about the pluses and minuses of using Python or Ruby in extending the croquet set. I've worked on the playing board a bit with moving things around and both approaches seem good. (Concrete Randoms like to try things out.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Thing Two says: I've been building out the board and running some speed tests against each. It looks like load times are about equal but moving between characters is not proven yet. (Concrete Randoms like a good competiton).
      </li>
      <li>
        Max says: Thanks everyone for coming. We'll be having egg-nog in the common area this afternoon to celebrate our employee ownership kick-off.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frownie Face Times Four</h3>
    <p>
        The drama continues. Members of the same set can cross each other and all members of the other sets. For example, The Lorax who works alone wouldn't be able to listen to another lorax. Especially another lorax. The Lorax works alone. Here's another version of the go-around-the-table meeting.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Thing One: I'd like to start the meeting by continuing the discussion Thing Two and I are having. I want to use Python but Thing Two wants to use Ruby. (And so on and so forth all the way to the egg-nog hard stop). The Concrete Randoms like competition and can rarely come to a conclusion in a discussion.
          </li>
          <li> Cindy Loo Who taps her pen. The Concrete Sequentialist is upset then people do not take turns.
          </li>
          <li> Max the manager wishes he didn't have to see these people this way. The Random Sequentialist hates conflict.
          </li>
          <li>The Lorax sighs. He hates it when people argue about a particular way of doing things. He'd rather that the Things listen to him about languages.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p> As a Concrete Random myself, I know that it's easy to alienate the Abstracts and the Sequentialists. But I also know that I can get bogged down by rules. In a pairing session, I've found it's good to pseudocode sections in order in a comment block. This also helps orient the other programmer. Either they'll see that as friendly or at least sequential. But then we are free to work on separate sections of the code with different approaches. Maybe even while coding in Stypi at the same time.  My brain works better when I can look at a few different parts at once. Just so long as I don't have to redo the exercise or explain how I got the answer.
