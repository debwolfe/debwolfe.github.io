        In a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzry6lmZ930">tribute</a> to Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. last night Cornel West asked us the following question. "I want to know what you are faithful to not what you are successful at". He also talked about the discouragement young people of color feel in public spaces. Stereotype threat is triggered by these subtle forms of discouragement. As an antidote to this negative effect on performance , Claude Steele suggests external signals of affirmation such as "I know you, and I know you can do this assignment." I elaborated on the antidote last week to suggest that meditation could be used to acknowledge the negative effects on the mental and physical state. When we start to become focused on the feeling of marginalization, we need to bring our attention back.

          When considering a list of values to affirm, I was pleased to find that some of the words that resonate with the Four Immeasurables. These four terms are starting points in a traditional Buddhist mindfulness practice. One way of engaging in the practice is to focus on each affirmation and offer the benefits to all beings. May all beings be happy and enjoy the causes of happiness. May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. May all beings not be separated from perfect joy. May all beings rest in great equanimity. In her wonderful address on the <a href = "http://www.khandrorinpoche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/MJKR-The-Four-Immeasurable-Qualities.pdf">Four Immeasurables</a>, Khandro Rinpoche gives some very practical advice. She says that's it's essential to see that we can't impose these qualities on ourselves or others when we wish. She suggests that we contemplate these values <i> just because </i>.

          Happiness, Freedom, Joy, Equanimity are especially effective top-level affirmations. They are immeasurable in the sense that they are unconditional. The don't depend on the cause and effect of perfomance.  As I look for other affirmation terms, I realize that they cluster around athletic, intellectual and vocational pursuits or periods of my life. Enthusiasm, creativity, co-operation, self-reliance, courage have helped me through various jobs and adventures. Introspection, truth, wisdom, peace, freedom are trickier since they often function as a standard to which I compare real life. When one feels threatened with despair, it's easy to feel the absence of these higher values and solidify the decision to reject the situation.

          Recently, I was discussing the human element in software development with a new friend. We descibed potential logistical problems and flawed responses to them. He was discussing this in the context of his own affirmation of learning. I've noticed that some people operate well in difficult situations when they view the experience as an opportunity to learn. I have a tendency to become hyper-aware of the negative effects of the problem. Sometimes this approach can foster extra motivation to discover the cause and effect. But other times, this type of diagnosis can upstage other positive affirmations such as patience, technique or just plain true-grit. Whatever happens, it's important to be hard on the issues but soft on the people.

          In closing his interview with Cornel West, Van Jones (<a href = "http://www.yeswecode.org/">Yes We Code </a> Founder) offered the following prognosis. He said that the very victims of stereotype threat are key to meeting the future catastrophe of a plutocratic society in decline. Because they have been stretched and disapointed, people on the margins have a developed an understanding of hope and unconditional love. They are the people who sing the blues.
