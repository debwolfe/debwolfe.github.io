        <p>
          It's always fun to see a Model T driving down the street. When asked whether my Dad let me drive his Model T when we were growing up, I said "No not driving. But we could honk the horn." Besides upgrading from the gas lanterns of horse-drawn carriages to battery powered lights, the 1917 horseless carriage also featured a powered-up 'aa-ooh-gah' horn. This was much better than the rubber gasket horn of the Marx brothers. Honking technology was crucial to turning around the general opinion on automobiles as silent pedestrian killers. Folks just weren't used to those contraptions coming down the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have all these new-found questions about the 1917 Model T horn. I'm interested not only in the wiring diagram, horn and button apparatus. I'd also like to hear about the development  and reception of the product. You might say, I have a cultural question that arises out of a very specific part to a single year of a Model T Ford pick-up. It used to be that we would look for answers in my Dad's Model T monthly digest. There weren't many pictures and it would take a while to get your question answered by a columnist.

        <p>
          There are some rules that transfer to today's on-line forum when trying to get a question considered by an interested party and then answered with just the right amount of detail.    </p>
          <ol> Make a good first impression.</ol>
            <li>  Choose a fitting title. If summarizing is difficult, write your post first and then formulate a title.</li>
            <li> Try to formulate your title as a  natural question. <i> How does a 1917 Model T Ford horn receive power?</i> and not <i> Model T Ford: [1917] horn power question. </i></li>
            <li> Indicate scope and domain in your title. Indicate the most important level of the application you are working in (pick the one where you are having a problem).</i>
          <ol> Introduce your problem. </ol>
            <li> Using proper spacing, capitalization, punctuation and paragraphs bring your reader up-to-date on the situation thus far.  Perhaps it might be helpful to write your problem in a text editor before submitting it on-line. (Turn on spell-check in Sublime with F6). </li>
              <li> Don't feel the need to personalize or greet..unwind the problem and it's domain first as best you can. Does it always occur? Have you gotten anything to work thus far? Is it a new problem with something that was working before? Are you open to an entirely new solution? Remember, an interesting problem will turn heads.</li>
              <li> Move on to sample code in subsequent paragraphs. Use the back tick symbol to format code blocks.</li>
          <ol> Provide evidence and support. </ol>
            <li> Keep the number of lines of code within 10. If needed, break up the blocks with explanatory code in the middle. Code sandwich. </li>
            <li> When linking to outside files, make sure the reader can access them. If it's a github repo, make sure that's public. Include relevant line numbers in the link.</li>
            <li> If it's a database question, set up some sample records with a header row and some comma separated data. If it's really crucial to process a bunch of data, provide the files in XML or comma-separated form.</li>
            <li> Keep looking in on your question. Provide ready clarification when hearing back from folks. Make sure to pick your favorite answer by checking the answer in the tick box. Choose the one that works for you--this may not even be the most complete or well-worded answer. Really, choose the syntax and method that works for you.</li>
            <p>
              Although these are good notes to myself, I do need to remember to post the question after all. Usually, I'm a lurker, a late-night googler or a theoretical question steward. Hey, once I start  submitting the questions on forums, I may be motivated to answer a few someday.
