            In the early days of the fying toaster screen saver, the idea of equipping small kitchen appliances with programmatic smarts seemed like a good one. Between the release of Berkeley System's After Dark screen saver in 1989 and Sun's release of Java in 1995, the feasability of endowing devices with code grew in tune to the cultural hope for small yet ubiquitous technology. <a href = "http://medianetwork.oracle.com/video/player/1881008974001">James Gosling </a> gave shape and an ethos to the development of Java with his WORA (write once read anywhere) aspiration. While it isn't synonymous with the open source creed, WORA couldn't thrive without developers talking about and planning for platform interoperability.

           The development of Java corresponded with the growth of networking. Developers knew that authentication across networks was a huge topic. Opening the network to lots of input and output from lots of devices also opened the whole place to the risk of malware. The internet, as a social system, rests on the ability to track a session to an ISP. The ability to hide behind a "bullet proof server" gives organized crime an advantage over enforcement agencies. From the late nineties happy vision of billions of networked devices running code, we fast forward to Brian Kreb's new book <a href = "http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/07/pre-order-your-copy-of-spam-nation-now/">'Spam Nation, The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime--From Global Epidemic to Your Front Door'</a>. That doesn't sound so good.

           One of the most recent credit card breaches that Krebs reports on relies on a smart small device that can accept input and send output. Customers at <a href = "http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/banks-credit-card-breach-at-bebe-stores/">Bebe</a> stores this December reported having their personal information stolen after swiping their cards at the magnetic stripe reader. This peripheral to the cash register can also accept a program encoded on a mag stripe. By swiping the card, the program is saved to memory and collects all additional swipes at that register. During a nightly upload from the point-of-sale system to the server, the program starts an FTP session and sends all the data out to hacker land. The program is hard to track, since it wipes itself off during a reboot. I daresay that a collective toaster that accepted credit cards would give me pause these days.
