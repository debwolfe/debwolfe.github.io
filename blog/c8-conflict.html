       How did it feel to face a conflict this week? I'll say it felt like I was tied to the kitchen phone waiting for a call. In a word, I was antsy. As the time passed, an orange creamsicle slowly dripped down my arm. I couldn't get up and I couldn't wait another second. Here's what happened. I was working an a project with another person. We came to the point where we could split up the deliverables and agreed to reconvene. So far so good. No that's not good at all. Here are the three questions that have to be answered in this situation. If I had to go back and do it again, I'd spend some time talking about these.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b> What time should we circle back again? </b> It's oh-so difficult to estimate the time it will take to finish a set of work. If we knew enough, we'd probably already be done. However, it <i> is </i> important to give an exact time to reconvene. This can be a time when we are not sure we will be completely done. But we should be on our way to sharing with the other team member.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b> How should we communicate? </b> What does circling mean to you? Is it a hang-out message a call, a text, an email? Or a git-hub check-in? Maybe it's a combination of those.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b> What is the exact form of the deliverable? </b> The lurking question behind this question is..are we both working on separate files that need to be merged? If that's so, we should each create a branch and plan to merge. Is there any way we can give it the one-two punch. First, one team member solves her part. Then the next team member can take the file over and do the rest. Are the pieces simple enough to be merged together successfully?
      </p>
      <p>
          Now friends, I've certainly asked more than three questions here.  In my moment of popsicle-dripping crisis, my head was spinning with explanations for a lapse in communication. It's mostly because I was worried about the acceptability of my solution. I didn't think it fit with the expecation of my team member. And I knew that it was going to be difficult to merge. And so there I was, wondering about what the other person thought over and over again. The resolution of this conflict was simple. My team member did get back to me. Dealing with the merge and the format change wasn't easy. But with all of my huffy momentum behind it, I was more than happy to get my back into fixing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing, here's some advice a friend gave me about the communication loop. She's an Information Architect and thinks about the preceding question set a bunch. "The very best text message is my two favorite letters." Oh yeah, what's that? "O and K". That's right. Whenever I get a message from someone I'm working with, I will always respond with an OK. It doesn't have to mean that you agree or that you are finished. You are just saying you read it. And Deb can stop waiting by the phone.
