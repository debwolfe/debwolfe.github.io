        In their 1999 paper <a href = "http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1086/209563"> ’Heart and Mind in Conflict: the Interplay of Affect and Cognition in Consumer Decision Making’</a> Baba Shiv and Alexander Fedorikhin, present their experiments on how subjects react in a social situation during a mental challenge. First, you take some students. Some you ask to memorize a two digit number. The others must memorize a seven digit number. They each have to walk down the hall to recite their number to the person in charge.
        </p>
        <p>
        While on their journey, some of them mumbling the number to themselves, they are intercepted by a nice hostess who offers them food to thank them for their participation. Chocolate Cake or Fruit Salad, hmmm? The ones tasked with the seven digit number choose the cake. The two digit champions choose the salad. The researchers conclude that during times of intense cognitive activity, “spontaneously evoked affective reactions rather than cognitions tend to have a greater impact on choice”. In other words, subjects were more vulnerable to their feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
        In turning my attention to choices made during pair programming, namely that I grabbed the cursor from my partner during my last guiding pairing session, I can honestly attest that this was a “spontaneously evoked affective reaction” during an hour long mental sprint. The session was going well; we were working on making the last test pass. It was the test on how many cakes or pies to make. If we just made cake instead of pie, we wouldn’t have to change the math. I grabbed the cursor away from the driver rather than explain what to type where.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now as good as these sweets from Laura Mead <a href = "http://www.lauramead.com/sweets/">look</a>, I muster that the affective motivation toward clearing the last test is even more strong. The cognitive resources required to do the challenge were also considerably more than than those required to memorize a seven digit number. The drive for reward after thinking hard for an hour grabbed me out of the blue. Was I merely driving the group effort forward where effort is not always founded out of rationality? Thankfully, my pair was also glad to see a green test field and the tense moment passed.
        </p>
        <p>
        Feedback about a tense moment might include the admission that we are more prone to strong affective reactions during intense mental exercises. Knowing that we are part heart and part mind is the first step to giving kind feedback. It’s also worth mentioning that we can have a strong emotional impact even when giving feedback on technical or intellectual exchanges. I’m still searching for a good formula for actionable feedback. “Try to be mindful of driver and navigator roles” is a pale version of “stop grabbing the wheel when it’s not your turn.”
