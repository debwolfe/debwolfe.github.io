        In his <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">address</a> to Columbia University in 2009, provost and social psychologist Claude Steele describes stereotype threat as a situational predicament. It's not that his studies seek to prove or disprove cognitive abilities of one group against another group. When we look closer at the way his studies are designed, his subjects are acting out of a situational predicament. Their predicament is that they perceive others to perceive them as belonging to a particular group. The usual test seeks to measure A doing C. These studies go something like this: A while doing C believes B to think that A is a member of D. A also thinks B believes that D's perform C only so well.

        He gives a personal example to illustrate the internal hijinx of all of that. He goes to pick up a grad student at her new place of work and all of a sudden he feels himself to be quite old. It's one of those new companies run by a 24 year old CEO. Everyone has his or her bicycle draped over the cubicle. Music, he's never heard those songs before, is playing everywhere. By the end of the walk through the office, he is feeling odd-man-out. We can extrapolate from there. What if he were hired to work there? How would such a feeling affect his work life? He is hypothesizing that his colleagues think that he is old and that old people don't contribute much.

        It's a radical leap but what if we were to compare Claude Steele's walk through the company to a woman whose husband has recently died. She walks through her village. If the village were in India, she might think about the now illegal practice of burning widows on the funeral pyres of their deceased spouses. Her living presence would be such an aberration that the only answer would be for her to expire. If the village were in Africa, she might be "chased off." She would no longer be allowed to own any household objects or land.  If she is young, she may be accused of causing her husband's death. In these cultures, women whose husbands have died are bad omens.

        My grandmother lost her husband at a young age.  I wonder whether she suffered from steretype threat. Our culture may not demonize widows but the negative characterizations of a widow's mental capabilities and emotional soundness must have shaped the last half of her life. Perhaps our society's version of a bad omen is to say that a person suffers from distraction and cannot balance a check-book.

       Claude Steele cites research about problem of giving negative feedback to students who are feeling stereo-type threat. We can say: "I know you and I know that you can perform well in this class". A more direct method is to teach people who suffer from stereotype threat to recognize their own bio-feedback patterns during a difficult task. The frustration is worse when an individual feels like she is being compared. Panic attacks and the problem of the dreadful comparison are both helped by meditation practice. The first step is to acknowledge the real mechanisms (the pulse goes up--cortisol levels go up) of a panic attack. Secondly, when we examine these societal predjudices, we know that they are emtpy concepts and cannot have any causal connection to our performance.
